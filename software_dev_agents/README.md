## Communication Flow:

- User interacts primarily with the Project Manager or Requirements Analyst.
- Project Manager delegates tasks down the hierarchy (Leads, Specialists).
- Leads delegate to their team members.
- Agents communicate laterally as needed (e.g., Frontend Dev talks to Backend Dev via Leads or directly if allowed by the supervisor logic).
- Specialists (DevOps, Security, DB Admin, etc.) are called upon by the Project Manager or Leads when their expertise is required.
- QA interacts with development outputs.
- Results flow back up the hierarchy to the Project Manager.

## Implementation Notes:

- Each agent will be implemented as a LangGraph graph (potentially a subgraph).
- Communication will primarily happen via state updates.
- Handoffs between agents will be managed by supervisor logic or specific handoff tools/commands.
- State needs to be carefully designed to pass relevant information (tasks, requirements, code snippets, test results, etc.) between agents.
