# TODO

- Implement auto-loading of dashboard data into memory during application startup.
  - Ensure data is fetched from the appropriate source (e.g., database, API, or mock data).
  - Add error handling for cases where data is unavailable or corrupted.
  - Log the status of the data loading process for debugging purposes.
  - Write unit tests to validate the auto-loading functionality.
- Update relevant documentation to reflect the new auto-loading behavior.
