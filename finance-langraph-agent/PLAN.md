# Project Analysis and Improvement Plan

This document outlines the steps to analyze and improve the finance-langraph-agent project.

## Phase 1: Analysis & Planning

1.  **Architecture Analysis (Delegated to Architect Mode):**

    - Analyze the current project structure (`src/`, `app.py`, `tests/`, etc.).
    - Evaluate the LangGraph implementation (`src/graph/`).
    - Identify architectural bottlenecks, potential improvements, and adherence to best practices.
    - Document findings and recommendations.

2.  **Prompt Analysis (Delegated to Code Mode):**

    - Review prompts defined in `src/agents/prompts.py`.
    - Assess clarity, effectiveness, and potential for prompt injection or ambiguity.
    - Suggest and potentially implement improvements to the prompts.
    - Document findings and changes.

3.  **Code Quality Analysis (Delegated to Code Mode):**
    - Analyze core application logic (`app.py`, `src/main.py`, `src/agents/`, `src/tools/`, `src/utils/`).
    - Check for code smells, potential bugs, inefficiencies, and adherence to `CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
    - Review test coverage in `tests/`.
    - Suggest and potentially implement refactoring and improvements.
    - Document findings and changes.

## Phase 2: Implementation & Integration

4.  **Implement Recommendations (Delegated to Code Mode):**
    - Based on the analysis phases, implement the approved architectural, prompt, and code quality improvements. This might be broken into smaller subtasks.
    - Ensure changes are integrated smoothly and tests pass.

## Phase 3: Verification

5.  **Testing and Verification (Manual/Automated):**
    - Run existing tests.
    - Perform manual testing if necessary (e.g., using `app_cli.py` or `streamlit_app.py`).
    - Verify the application functions as expected with the improvements.

## Phase 4: Final Report

6.  **Summarize Results (BoomerangMode):**
    - Compile the outcomes from all subtasks.
    - Provide a final report summarizing the changes and improvements made.

_(This plan will be executed sequentially by delegating tasks to appropriate modes.)_
