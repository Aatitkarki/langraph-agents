# LangGraph Use Cases & Features

This document outlines various potential applications and features that can be built using LangGraph, leveraging its capabilities for state management, cycles, tool integration, human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-agent systems.

1.  **Multi-Agent Debate/Discussion Simulator:**

    - **Concept:** Simulate a debate or discussion between multiple AI agents with different personas, roles, or viewpoints on a given topic.
    - **LangGraph Features:** Multi-agent architecture (network or supervisor), state management (tracking arguments, discussion history), conditional routing (deciding who speaks next, ending the debate).
    - **Implementation:** Define agents (e.g., Proponent, Opponent, Moderator), manage turns, evaluate arguments.

2.  **Self-Correcting RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**

    - **Concept:** An agent retrieves information, generates an answer, reflects on the answer's quality based on the retrieved documents, and iteratively refines the retrieval query and the answer if necessary.
    - **LangGraph Features:** Cycles (retrieve -> generate -> reflect -> retrieve loop), state management (query, documents, answer, critique), conditional edges (decide if refinement is needed).
    - **Implementation:** Nodes for retrieval, generation, reflection/critique.

3.  **Human-in-the-Loop Content Moderation/Generation:**

    - **Concept:** An agent drafts content (e.g., email, blog post, code). The draft is presented to a human for review, editing, or approval before finalization or further action (e.g., sending the email).
    - **LangGraph Features:** Human-in-the-loop (`interrupt`), state management (draft content, review status, final content), persistence (to allow review later).
    - **Implementation:** Nodes for drafting, human review (using `interrupt`), finalization.

4.  **Layered Agent System for Complex Research:**

    - **Concept:** A hierarchical system where a top-level agent breaks down a complex research question, delegates sub-questions to specialized search/analysis agents, and synthesizes the results.
    - **LangGraph Features:** Multi-agent (hierarchical supervisor), subgraphs (for specialized agents), state management (main question, sub-questions, intermediate results, final report).
    - **Implementation:** Supervisor agent, specialized agents (e.g., web searcher, data analyzer, summarizer) possibly as subgraphs.

5.  **Interactive Tutorial/Onboarding Agent:**

    - **Concept:** An agent guides a user through a process or tutorial step-by-step, adapting based on user responses or actions. It can ask questions, provide explanations, and check understanding.
    - **LangGraph Features:** State management (user progress, current step, user responses), conditional edges (based on user input), human-in-the-loop (`interrupt` for user input/actions), cycles (repeating steps if needed).
    - **Implementation:** Nodes for presenting information, asking questions, evaluating responses.

6.  **Tool-Using Agent with Dynamic Tool Selection:**

    - **Concept:** An agent has access to a large number of tools but dynamically selects a relevant subset based on the current query or state before deciding which specific tool to use.
    - **LangGraph Features:** State management (available tools, selected tools, query), multiple nodes (tool selection node, agent node, tool execution node), conditional edges.
    - **Implementation:** Vector store for tool descriptions, retrieval node for selection, agent node binds selected tools. (See `how-tos/many-tools.ipynb`).

7.  **Personalized Trip Planner with Memory:**
    - **Concept:** An agent helps plan trips, remembering user preferences (budget, interests, past trips) across different sessions to provide tailored recommendations.
    - **LangGraph Features:** Persistence (checkpointer for session memory), long-term memory (Store API for preferences), state management (current trip plan, user preferences), tool use (flight/hotel search APIs).
    - **Implementation:** Nodes for preference retrieval/update, recommendation generation, tool calls, itinerary building.
